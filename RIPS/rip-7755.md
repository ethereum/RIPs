## Abstract

Contracts for facilitating request, fulfillment, and fulfillment reward of cross-L2 calls.

## Motivation

Cross-chain actions are an increasingly important part of crypto user experience. Today, most solutions for Ethereum layer 2s (L2s) have one or more of the following drawbacks.

1. Reliance on privatized relayers with offchain access and incentives.
1. Reliance on protocols outside of Ethereum and its rollups.
1. High-level, intent-based systems that do not allow specifying exact calls to make.

Ethereum L2s, which all write state to a shared execution environment, are uniquely positioned to offer an alternative. Ethereum L2 users should have access to a public, decentralized utility for making cross L2 calls.

From any L2 chain, users should be able to request a call be made on any other L2 chain. Users should be able to guarantee a compensation for this call being made, and thus be able to control the likelihood this call will be made.

User should have full assurance that compensation will only be paid if the call was made. This assurance should depend ONLY on onchain information.

## Specification

To only rely on onchain information, we use

1. Layer 1 (L1), i.e. Ethereum Mainnet, blockhashes on the L2.
   - We take as an assumption that every Ethereum L2 should have a trusted L1 blockhash in the execution environment.
2. Ethereum L2 blockhashes on L1.
   - e.g. via an [L2 Output Oracle Contract](https://specs.optimism.io/glossary.html?#l2-output-oracle-contract)

Using these inputs, on any Ethereum L2, we can trustlessly verify [ERC-1186](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1186) storage proofs of any other Ethereum L2.

Our contracts' job, then, is to represent call requests and fulfillment in storage on each chain.

### Structs

```solidity
/// @notice Low-level call specs representing the desired transaction on destination chain
struct Call {
    /// @dev The address to call
    address to;
    /// @dev The calldata to call with
    bytes data;
    /// @dev The native asset value of the call
    uint256 value;
}

/// @notice A cross chain call request formatted following the RIP-7755 spec
struct CrossChainRequest {
    /// @dev The account submitting the cross chain request
    address requester;
    /// @dev Array of calls to make on the destination chain
    Call[] calls;
    /// @dev The source chain contract address that will verify state on the destination chain
    address proverContract;
    /// @dev The chainId of the destination chain
    uint256 destinationChainId;
    /// @dev The L2 contract on destination chain that's storage will be used to verify whether or not this call was made
    address inboxContract;
    /// @dev The L1 address of the contract that should have L2 block info stored
    address l2Oracle;
    /// @dev The storage key at which we expect to find the L2 block info on the l2Oracle
    bytes32 l2OracleStorageKey;
    /// @dev The address of the ERC20 reward asset to be paid to whoever proves they filled this call
    /// @dev Native asset specified as in ERC-7528 format
    address rewardAsset;
    /// @dev The reward amount to pay
    uint256 rewardAmount;
    /// @dev The minimum age of the L1 block used for the proof
    uint256 finalityDelaySeconds;
    /// @dev The nonce of this call, to differentiate from other calls with the same values
    uint256 nonce;
    /// @dev The timestamp at which this request will expire
    uint256 expiry;
    /// @dev An optional pre-check contract address on the destination chain
    /// @dev Zero address represents no pre-check contract desired
    /// @dev Can be used for arbitrary validation of fill conditions
    address precheckContract;
    /// @dev Arbitrary encoded precheck data
    bytes precheckData;
}

/// @notice Stored on verifyingContract and proved against in originationContract
struct FulfillmentInfo {
    /// @dev Block timestamp when fulfilled
    uint96 timestamp;
    /// @dev Msg.sender of fulfillment call
    address filler;
}
```

### Flow Diagrams

#### Happy Case

![image](../assets/rip-7755/happy_case.png "Happy case flow")

1. User calls to an `RIP7755Outbox` contract with `CrossChainRequest` and reward funds
1. `RIP7755Outbox` emits event for fulfillers to discover
1. Fulfiller relays `CrossChainRequest` to `RIP7755Inbox` contract, including any funds possibly needed to successfully complete the call
1. If included, `RIP7755Inbox` makes a precheck call to validate fulfillment condition(s)
1. `RIP7755Inbox` makes the call as specified by `CrossChainRequest`
1. `RIP7755Inbox` write to storage the `FulfillmentInfo` receipt of the call
1. After `CrossChainRequest.finalityDelaySeconds` have elapsed, the fulfiller can submit the proof
1. If the proof is valid and the call was successfully made, fulfiller is paid reward

### RIP7755Outbox Contract

On the origin chain, there is an outbox contract to receive cross-chain call requests and payout rewards on proof of their fulfillment.

### PrecheckContract Interface

On the destination chain, any valid precheck contract must adhere to the following interface.

```solidity
interface IPrecheckContract {
    /// @notice A precheck function declaration.
    ///
    /// @param request A cross chain call request formatted following the RIP-7755 spec. See {RIP7755Structs-CrossChainRequest}.
    /// @param caller The address of the fulfiller account that submitted the transaction to RIP7755Inbox.
    function precheckCall(CrossChainRequest calldata request, address caller) external;
}
```

### Storage Proof Validation

The implementation details for successful storage proof validation will vary depending on the destination chain. However, all implementations will adhere to the following fundamental pattern:

1. Verify that the beacon root used for the proof corresponds to the root exposed in the source chain's execution environment.
1. Validate the L1 execution client's state root against the beacon root.
1. Validate the destination chain's output contract storage root against the L1 execution client's state root.
1. Validate the destination chain's state root against the destination chain's output contract storage root.
1. Validate the destination chain's inbox contract storage root against the destination chain's state root.
1. Validate the `FulfillmentInfo` struct at the correct storage key against the destination chain's inbox contract storage root.

It is important to note that not all L2 chains directly store their state root on L1. In certain cases, the L2 chain stores an abstract "output root" which must be connected to its state root in some manner. In these instances, the storage proof validation necessitates an intermediate step between steps 4 and 5. This step involves providing the destination chain's state root along with custom logic to derive the output root using that state root and any other required information. This step is only considered successful if the derived output root matches the value proven to be stored in the destination chain's output contract on L1.

## Example Usage

_These examples are not intended to be comprehensive of every detail. First example is more verbose, in hopes of giving helpful understanding for all examples._

### Transfer native asset across chains.

**User at Address A on Chain X wants to send 0.1 ether to Address B on Chain Y.**

On Chain X, Address A calls `requestCrossChainCall` on a `RIP7755Outbox` contract of their choosing. `CrossChainRequest.calls` contains a single call.

```solidity
Call({
  to: <Address B>,
  value: 0.1 ether,
  data: ""
})
```

The `CrossChainRequest` includes info about the destination chain and `RIP7755Inbox` contract the user wants the call to be made through.

The destination chain has a 7 day challenge period, and so the user sets `CrossChainRequest.finalityDelaySeconds` to a 7 day equivalent for maximum security.

When calling to `requestCrossChainCall` on origin chain, the user sends 0.1001 ether in value, which matches `CrossChainRequest.rewardAmount`. The excess above 0.1 ether is intended to exceed the gas cost of the call on destination chain and serve as a compensation to the fulfiller. This reward amount would need to provide sufficient incentive for the fulfiller to wait `CrossChainRequest.finalityDelaySeconds`, in this case 7 days, to get their reward.

**Include custom exclusivity period for a specified fulfiller**

To enhance the previous example, we introduce a precheck condition where Address A authorizes only a specific fulfiller, referred to as Fulfiller A, to submit the transaction to the destination chain for a specified period of time.

To implement this, custom exclusivity logic must be incorporated into a precheck smart contract (PCSM) deployed on the destination chain. The `CrossChainRequest` will include the PCSM address in the `precheckContract` field and encoded data for exclusivity validation in the `precheckData` field.

```solidity
    CrossChainCall({
      ...
      precheckContract: <PCSM address on destination chain>,
      precheckData: abi.encode(<filler address>, expirationTimestamp),
      ...
    })
```

Once Address A invokes `requestCrossChainCall` on the origin chain, if an unintended fulfiller attempts to submit the transaction on the destination chain within the exclusivity period, the `fulfill` function call will revert due to the precheck failure. This ensures that only Fulfiller A can call `fulfill` before the `expirationTimestamp`.

### Transfer ERC20 asset across chains.

**User at Address A on Chain X wants to send 100 USDC to Address B on Chain Y.**

ERC20 transfers have unique challenges in our paradigm, because

<ol type="A">
  <li>The caller needs to specify the exact calls to make.</li>
  <li>The calls must be made through the inbox contract.</li>
</ol>

We show two example solutions below.

#### 1. With known fulfiller address

The following example requires the caller to know ahead of time the fulfillers address. This is not ideal because (1) the calls will only work for one fulfiller (2) requires offchain pre-coordination.

- Origin Chain:
  - Pre-steps:
    - Address A calls to USDC contract on origination chain to approve `RIP7755Outbox` to move 100 USDC.
  - Address A calls to outbox, with a two calls in `CrossChainRequest.calls`
    - ```solidity
        Call({
          to: <USDC contract on destination chain>,
          value: 0,
          data: abi.encodeWithSelector(ERC20.transferFrom.selector, <fulfiller address>, <RIP7755Inbox contract address>, 100 * (10 ** USDC.decimals()))
        })
      ```
    - ```solidity
        Call({
          to: <USDC contract on destination chain>,
          value: 0,
          data: abi.encodeWithSelector(ERC20.transfer.selector, <Address B>, 100 * (10 ** USDC.decimals()))
        })
      ```
- Destination Chain
  - Pre-steps
    - Fulfiller calls to USDC contract on destination chain to approve `RIP7755Inbox` to move 100 USDC.
  - Fulfiller calls `fulfill` on `RIP7755Inbox`
    - In the first call of `CrossChainRequest.calls`, 100 USDC is sent from fulfiller to `RIP7755Inbox`.
    - In second call, 100 USDC is sent from `RIP7755Inbox` to Address B.

#### 2. With helper contract

We could also solve the challenge by introducing a helper contract for facilitating the ERC20 transfer. This helper contract would accept calls in the format `transfer(address asset, address to, uint256 amount)` and then would use `tx.origin` to determine the `from` for the ERC20 `transferFrom` call (and check `msg.sender` is some known `RIP7755Inbox` contract). This would rely on fulfillers pre-depositing ERC20s in this helper contract, or having approvals set so it can pull funds at any time.

> [!NOTE]  
> In future drafts, we may specify an implementation of `HelperContract`. It may also be convenient for fulfillers to be able to auth with signature. This could maybe be accomplished via some `context` that could be passed to `fulfill` and stored in `RIP7755Inbox` for the duration of the call.

- Origin Chain:
  - Pre-steps:
    - Address A calls to USDC contract on origination chain to approve `RIP7755Outbox` to move 100 USDC.
  - Address A calls to outbox, with a one call in `CrossChainRequest.calls`
    - ```solidity
        Call({
          to: <USDC contract on destination chain>,
          value: 0,
          data: abi.encodeWithSelector(HelperContract.transfer.selector, CrossChainRequest.rewardAsset, <Address B>, 100 * (10 ** USDC.decimals()))
        })
      ```
- Destination Chain
  - Pre-steps
    - Fulfiller calls to USDC contract on destination chain to approve `HelperContract` to move 100 USDC.
  - Fulfiller calls `fulfill` on `RIP7755Inbox`
    - Call transfers 100 USDC to Address B via `HelperContract`.
