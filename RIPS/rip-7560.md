## Abstract

Combining the [EIP-2938](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2938)
and [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337)
into a comprehensive Native Account Abstraction proposal.

We propose splitting the Ethereum transaction scope into multiple steps: validations, execution,
and post-transaction logic.
Transaction validity is determined by the result of the validation steps of a transaction.

We further separate transaction validation for the purposes of authorization and the gas fee payment,
allowing contract B to pay gas for a transaction that will be executed from account contract A.

The benefits are in backward compatibility with the emerging ERC-4337 ecosystem while achieving the
long-term goal of Native Account Abstraction.

## Motivation

ERC-4337 can do a lot as a purely voluntary ERC. However, any of the out-of-protocol ways of achieving
Account Abstraction faces several drawbacks compared to native support. There are a few key areas where
it is weaker than a truly in-protocol solution:

* Existing users cannot benefit from it or upgrade to use it without moving all their assets and activity
  to a new account.

* Extra gas overhead of ~42k for a basic `UserOperation` compared to ~21k for a basic transaction.

* Less benefit from in-protocol censorship resistance techniques such as crLists, which target transactions
  and would miss `UserOperations`.

* Relying on a significantly smaller set of participating nodes and non-standard RPC methods like
  `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional`.

* Inability to use `tx.origin` or contracts that rely on it as it returns the meaningless address of a bundler.

EIP-2938 defines a very mature alternative approach to Account Abstraction. However, it does not translate
well to the architecture of ERC-4337 that is being used in production without any protocol changes.
Therefore, the implementation of EIP-2938 will not benefit as much from the production experience gained by using
ERC-4337 and from maintaining backward compatibility with it.

There is also a possibility that at some point in the future, the EOAs on Ethereum will be replaced with pre-deployed
smart contracts. This, however, is impossible without an addition of Native Account Abstraction to the protocol.

### New Transaction Type

A new [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) transaction with type AA_TX_TYPE is introduced. Transactions of this type are referred to as
“AA transactions”. Their payload should be interpreted as:

```

0x04 || 0x00 || rlp([
  chainId, sender, nonce, builderFee,
  callData,
  paymaster, paymasterData,
  deployer, deployerData,
  maxPriorityFeePerGas, maxFeePerGas,
  validationGasLimit, paymasterValidationGasLimit,
  callGasLimit, paymasterPostOpGasLimit
  accessList, signature
])

```

The base gas cost of this transaction is set to AA_BASE_GAS_COST instead of 21000 to reflect the lack of “intrinsic”
ECDSA signature verification.

### Gas fees are charged directly from the contract balance

The maximum gas cost of the AA_TX_TYPE transaction is defined as:

```

maxPossibleGasCost = AA_BASE_GAS_COST +
  validationGasLimit +
  paymasterValidationGasLimit +
  callGasLimit +
  paymasterPostOpGasLimit

```

If `paymaster` is not specified, the `maxPossibleGasCost` is charged up-front, before any computation is done in any
execution frame, from the balance of the `sender` address.
If `paymaster` is specified, the gas cost is charged from its balance.
The transaction is invalid if the balance of the account that is being pre-charged,
whether it is a `sender` or a `paymaster`, is insufficient.
After the transaction finishes its execution, the address that was pre-charged may receive a gas refund.

The meanings of the `maxPriorityFeePerGas` and `maxFeePerGas` are unchanged from how they are defined in the
[EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559).

### Gas fees charged for transaction input

For all the existing transaction types, G_txdatazero (4 gas) and G_txdatanonzero (16 gas) per byte is
charged for the `data` parameter.

Transaction Type AA_TX_TYPE introduces the following dynamic length inputs: `callData`, `paymasterData`,
`deployerData`, `signature`. Each of these parameters' gas cost is counted towards transaction data cost.
This transaction data gas cost is referred to as `calldataGasUsed` and is subtracted from the `validationGasLimit`
before execution of the transaction.
The transaction is considered INVALID if `validationGasLimit` is smaller than `calldataGasUsed`.

### Builder Fee

As we need to account for an additional off-chain work that block builders have to perform to
include `AA_TX_TYPE` transactions in their blocks, as well as a potential L1 gas cost for builders
operating on L2 rollups, and given that this work does not correspond to the amount of gas spent on
validation and is not linked to the gas price, the `sender` may decide
to pay an extra `builderFee` as a "tip" to the block builder.

This value is denominated in wei and is passed from the `sender`, or the `paymaster` if it is specified,
to the `coinbase` of the current block as part of the gas pre-charge.

### Multiple execution frames for a single transaction

All existing transaction types only have an implicit validation phase where balance, nonce, and signature are checked,
and a single top-level execution frame with
`tx.origin == msg.sender` which is the address that is determined by a transaction ECDSA signature.

When processing a transaction of type `AA_TX_TYPE`, however, multiple execution frames will be created.
The full list of possible frames tries to replicate the ERC-4337 flow:

1. Validation Phase
   * `sender` deployment frame (once per account)
   * `sender` validation frame (required)
   * `paymaster` validation frame (optional)
2. Execution Phase
   * `sender` execution frame (required)
   * `paymaster` post-transaction frame (optional)

All execution frames in the "Validation Phase" must be completed successfully without reverting, and the return value
for `sender` and `paymaster` validation frames must include `MAGIC_VALUE_SENDER` and `MAGIC_VALUE_PAYMASTER` accordingly
in order for the transaction to be considered valid for a given position in a block.

In all top-level frames, the global variables have the following meaning:

| Opcode Name | Solidity Equivalent | Value                                                                         |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CALLER`    | `msg.sender`        | The `AA_ENTRY_POINT` address. `AA_SENDER_CREATOR` for the "deployment frame". |
| `ORIGIN`    | `tx.origin`         | The transaction `sender` address                                              |
| `CALLDATA*` | `msg.data`          | The transaction data is set to inputs of the corresponding frame              |

#### Sender deployment frame

The `deployer` address is invoked with the `deployerData` as call data input from the `AA_SENDER_CREATOR` address.

The gas limit of this frame is set to `validationGasLimit`.
The amount of gas used by this frame is referred to as `senderCreationGasUsed`.

The sender deployment frame MUST result in the `sender` address becoming
initialized with contract code.

#### Sender validation frame

We define the following Solidity struct to represent the AA transaction on-chain:

```solidity

struct TransactionType4 {
    address sender;
    address paymaster;
    address deployer;
    uint256 nonce;
    uint256 validationGasLimit;
    uint256 paymasterValidationGasLimit;
    uint256 paymasterPostOpGasLimit;
    uint256 callGasLimit;
    uint256 maxFeePerGas;
    uint256 maxPriorityFeePerGas;
    uint256 builderFee;
    bytes paymasterData;
    bytes deployerData;
    bytes callData;
    bytes signature;
}

```

We then define the following Solidity method and the `sender` of the transaction is invoked with the corresponding data:

```solidity

function validateTransaction(uint256 version, bytes32 txHash, bytes transaction) external returns (uint256 validationData);

```

The gas limit of this frame is set to `validationGasLimit - senderCreationGasUsed - calldataGasUsed`.\
The `transaction` parameter is interpreted as an ABI encoding of `TransactionType4`.\
The `txHash` parameter represents the hash of the AA_TX_TYPE transaction with empty signature, as defined in section
[Calculation of Transaction Type AA_TX_TYPE hash](#calculation-of-transaction-type-aatxtype-hash).\
The `version` parameter is added in order to maintain the Solidity method ID in case of changes to this struct
in future revisions of this EIP.

The amount of gas used by this frame is referred to as `senderValidationGasUsed`.

The frame must return 32 bytes `validationData` that is interpreted as:

```solidity

abi.encodePacked(MAGIC_VALUE_SENDER, validUntil, validAfter)

```

In order to allow a gas estimation to determine the amount of gas that this frame
requires to complete successfully while not having the actual `signature` value, this function
should avoid reverting on invalid signature, and should return a value different from `MAGIC_VALUE_SENDER`.

Type of the `validUntil` is 6-byte timestamp value, or zero for "infinite". The transaction is valid only up to this time.
Type of the `validAfter` is 6-byte timestamp. The transaction is valid only after this time.

The `validateTransaction` function can choose to revert on any condition that can be satisfied during gas estimation.

#### Paymaster validation frame

The `paymaster` of the transaction, if specified, is invoked with the following data:

```solidity

function validatePaymasterTransaction(uint256 version, bytes32 txHash, bytes transaction) external returns (bytes context, uint256 validationData);

```

The gas limit of this frame is set to `paymasterValidationGasLimit`.

The amount of gas used by this frame is referred to as `paymasterValidationGasUsed`.

The `transaction` parameter is interpreted as an ABI encoding of `TransactionType4`.\
The `txHash` parameter represents the hash of the AA_TX_TYPE transaction with empty signature, as defined in section
[Calculation of Transaction Type AA_TX_TYPE hash](#calculation-of-transaction-type-aatxtype-hash).

The frame must return a bytes array that is interpreted as:

```solidity

abi.encode(context, MAGIC_VALUE_PAYMASTER, validUntil, validAfter)

```

Same as in the [`sender` validation frame](#sender-validation-frame), in order to support gas estimation this
frame should return a value different from `MAGIC_VALUE_PAYMASTER` for conditions that cannot be satisfied
before signing.

The size of the `context` byte array may not exceed `MAX_CONTEXT_SIZE` for a transaction to be considered valid.

#### Sender execution frame

The `sender` address is invoked with `callData` input.

The gas limit of this frame is set to `callGasLimit`.\
Calculation of the `calldataGasUsed` value is defined in the
[Gas fees charged for transaction input](#gas-fees-charged-for-transaction-input) section.\
The amount of gas used by this frame is referred to as `gasUsedByExecution`.

The validation frames do not revert if the execution frame reverts.
The `postPaymasterTransaction` may still be called with a `success: false` flag.

#### Paymaster post-transaction frame

After the sender execution frame is over the `paymaster` may need to perform some post-transaction logic,
for instance to perform some kind of cleanup or bookkeeping.
If the gas payment validation returned a non-zero `context`, the `paymaster` is invoked again
with the following inputs:

```solidity

function postPaymasterTransaction(bool success, uint256 actualGasCost, bytes context) external;

```

The `actualGasCost` parameter is the actual amount paid by the paymaster for this transaction,
and `success` indicates whether this transaction's execution frame completed without revert.

The gas limit of this frame is set to `paymasterPostOpGasLimit`.

Revert in the `postPaymasterTransaction` frame reverts the transaction's execution frame as well.
The validation frames do not revert if the `postPaymasterTransaction` frame reverts.
The gas fees charged from the `paymaster` will still include the gas cost of the reverted execution frame.

### Execution flow diagram

The execution flow determined by an Account Abstraction Transaction is visualised by the following flow diagram:

![](../assets/rip-7560/flow_diagram.png)
*Execution flow for the Native Account Abstraction Transactions*

### Execution layer transaction validation

On the execution layer, the transaction validity conditions for a block are extended as follows:

```

func validateAccountAbstractionTransaction(tx *Transaction) {
    assert !(sender.code.length > 0 && deployer != address(0))

    if (sender.code.length == 0 && deployer != address(0)) {
        calldataGasUsed := calculateCallDataGasUsed(tx)
        retDeployer, error := evm.Call(
            from: AA_SENDER_CREATOR,
            to: deployer,
            input: deployerData,
            gas: validationGasLimit - calldataGasUsed)
        assert error == nil
        assert sender.code.length > 0
    }

    if (paymaster != address(0)) {
        paymasterInput := ABI.encodeWithSelector('validatePaymasterTransaction', tx, tx.hash)
        retPaymaster, error := evm.Call(
            from: AA_ENTRY_POINT,
            to: paymaster,
            input: paymasterInput,
            gas: paymasterValidationGasLimit)
        assert error == nil
        assert Date.now() <= retPaymaster.validUntil
        assert Date.now() >= retPaymaster.validAfter
        assert retPaymaster.isValid
    }

    if (sender.code.length == 0) {
      signer := ecrecover(tx.hash, tx.signature)
      assert signer == sender.address
    } else {
      senderInput := ABI.encodeWithSelector('validateTransaction', tx, tx.hash);
      retSender, error := evm.Call(
          from: AA_ENTRY_POINT,
          to: sender,
          input: senderInput,
          gas: validationGasLimit - retDeployer.gasUsed)
      assert error == nil
      assert Date.now() <= retSender.validUntil
      assert Date.now() >= retSender.validAfter
      assert retSender.isValid
    }
}

```

In order to defend from DoS attack vectors, the block builders performing mempool transaction validation SHOULD consider
the opcode banning and storage access rules described in ERC-7562.

[Block validation](#execution-layer-block-validation) takes roughly the same amount of work as without AA transactions.
In any case, validation must execute the entire block in order to verify the state change.
During this execution, it currently verifies signatures, nonces, and gas payment.
With Account Abstraction, it will also verify that all the validation frames were successful.
There is a slight increase in required memory mostly used to store the `context` value that is passed from
the `paymaster` validation frame to its post-transaction frame.

As long as all transaction validation steps return correct values the block is considered valid.
Block builders who are willing to relax the rules applied to the validation frames MAY do so.

Such transactions MUST NOT be propagated through the default transaction mempool as they will be rejected by the nodes
and the sending node will be blocked as a spammer.
They may be propagated in the alternative mempool that allows them explicitly as defined in ERC-7562.

### Transaction flow diagram

Zooming into a single transaction, the validation part of an AA transaction may include multiple execution frames:

![](../assets/rip-7560/zoom_into_transaction.png)
*Frames within a single Native Account Abstraction Transaction within a block*

### Transaction validity time range parameters

The `Paymaster validation frame` and the `Sender validation frame` each return values `validUntil` and `validAfter`.

These values allow the `sender` and `paymaster` contracts to specify
a time range for the blocks the transaction will be valid for.

Transaction cannot be included in a block outside of this time range.
If included, such a block is considered invalid.

Passing `validUntil = 0` and `validAfter = 0` disables the check.

### Calculation of Transaction Type AA_TX_TYPE hash

```

keccak256(AA_TX_TYPE || 0x00 || rlp(transaction_payload)

```

Note that the `chainId` and `accessList` parameters are included in the transaction hash calculation but are not
available on-chain as part of the `TransactionType4` struct.

In order to calculate the transaction hash that will be used during the signing of the transaction and validation of
the transaction signature by the `sender`, the value of the `signature` parameter is considered to be an empty
byte array.

## Rationale

### Using Solidity method selectors in a Core EIP

The contracts that have a role in this Account Abstraction proposal, such as `sender` or `paymaster`,
MUST know which code to execute and understand the calldata provided to them in order to validate the transaction.

We argue that the most straightforward implementation is to rely on Solidity 4-byte method selectors as it is an
established de-facto standard.

### Calling the `deployer` from the `AA_SENDER_CREATOR` addres

It is important that the `deployer` is **not** invoked from the `AA_ENTRY_POINT` but from the `AA_SENDER_CREATOR`.

This is necessary to guarantee that `AA_ENTRY_POINT` may never initiate a call to a `sender` execution function
without first completing a successful validation.
Without this protection, as we do not control the `deployerData` field, it may be constructed to look like
a legitimate call from the `AA_ENTRY_POINT` to the `sender`.

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP preserves most of the design elements established by the ERC-4337. This allows the same client code and smart
contracts to be used in both systems with minimal to no modifications, while providing significant UX improvements.

Existing contracts are not significantly affected by the change.
The assumption that `tx.origin` is guaranteed to be an EOA is no longer valid.
The assumption that `tx.origin` is the address that pays for the current transaction is no longer valid as well.

Any code that expects a single top-level execution frame for an Ethereum transaction will have to accommodate
the new transaction type.

[EIP-3607](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3607) introduces a ban on transactions from senders with deployed code.
This limitation does not apply to AA_TX_TYPE transactions.

### Deterministic addresses and Smart Contract Account `nonce` value

Before RIP-7560, for accounts with associated code (smart contracts), the account nonce is only used and incremented
when the account executes the `CREATE` (`0xf0`) opcode.

With RIP-7560, the `sender` account's `nonce` will be incremented before a transaction execution starts.
Developer tooling that rely on counterfactual addresses should take that into account or risk missing the right address.

This does not affect addresses created with the `CREATE2` opcode as their address does not depend on the `nonce` used.

### Migration path for existing ERC-4337 projects and further roadmap

#### Existing bundlers can co-exist on the network

The ERC-4337 is not a protocol change and may remain operational in parallel to this EIP indefinitely.
Given the similarity to ERC-4337, the same block builders may easily support both ERC-4337 and `AA_TX_TYPE` transactions.

#### Accounts need to upgrade their `EntryPoint` to an adapter contract

The team behind ERC-4337 will provide a reference implementation of a contract converting
the ABI of the `paymaster` and `sender` contracts. This adapter can be set as a trusted
`EntryPoint` address by the ERC-4337 contracts.

#### Supporting ERC-4337 RPC calls as a compatibility layer

The `sender` contracts MAY support both ERC-4337 and `AA_TX_TYPE` transactions during a transition period,
as long as this EIP may be adopted by some chains and not by others.

## Security Considerations

This EIP creates a complex and sophisticated mechanism and aims to expand the usage of Smart Contract Accounts.
All of it creates a lot of new risk vectors and attack surfaces.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of known security considerations regarding Native Account Abstraction.

### DoS attacks on block builders

The amount of computation and available memory that is necessary to maintain a mempool and produce valid blocks is
increased significantly.

### Directly charging the balance of a contract

This EIP adds a new way for a smart contract to have its balance charged simply by returning a valid value from a
function with method ID that corresponds to `validateTransaction`, `validatePaymasterTransaction`.

This creates a new kind of risk for contracts that accidentally or maliciously contain such methods but are not public
about the fact that these contracts can be used as a `sender` or a `paymaster` in an `AA_TX_TYPE` transaction.

This is somewhat mitigated by requiring these contracts to return `MAGIC_VALUE_SENDER` or `MAGIC_VALUE_PAYMASTER`,
however code reviewers should still be aware of this.

### Observing revert reasons in a validation frame

Existing transaction types get included in a block even if reverted and provide a revert reason for debugging purposes.
There is a very short list of things that can cause a transaction not to be included on-chain:

* low gas fee
* insufficient balance
* invalid nonce
* censorship

This is not the case for reverts that occur in the validation phase of an `AA_TX_TYPE` transaction.
In order to address this developers should track the validity of these transactions being signed and are encouraged
to rely on the `validUntil` time range parameter to guarantee a transaction that has not been included in the intended time
will not become valid again unexpectedly for the user who had sent it.

### Denial of Service attacks on the block builder

It is important to consider the ability of the block builder to fill the block with transactions in the allotted time.

In terms of block validity, all validation and execution frames may read and write any state when included in the block.
This means that transactions are technically able to invalidate each other.

Block builders that rely on a decentralized and permissionless transaction mempool face a risk of having their entire
transaction mempool being invalidated by a single transaction they pick from it, causing the Denial of Service.
Sequencer-like block builders do not have such a risk as long as they process incoming transactions in the order they are received.

As part of the mitigation, the AA transactions in the mempool SHOULD be bound by storage access rules to avoid
DoS on block builders.
These rules are defined in [ERC-7562](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eips/eip-7562).

The full mitigation may be achieved by separating the validation from into a separate context as described in the
[RIP-xxxx](./rip-xxxx.md).
